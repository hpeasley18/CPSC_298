Here is a simple implementation of a blackjack game in C code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int drawCard() {
    return rand() % 10 + 1;
}

int main() {
    srand(time(NULL));
    
    int humanScore = 0;
    int computerScore = 0;
    int choice;
    
    printf("Welcome to Blackjack!\n");
    
    while (1) {
        printf("Your current score is: %d\n", humanScore);
        printf("1. Hit\n2. Stay\n");
        
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        
        if (choice == 1) {
            humanScore += drawCard();
            
            if (humanScore > 21) {
                printf("Bust! You lose.\n");
                break;
            }
        } else if (choice == 2) {
            break;
        } else {
            printf("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n");
        }
    }
    
    printf("Computer's turn...\n");
    
    while (computerScore < 17) {
        computerScore += drawCard();
    }
    
    printf("Computer's score: %d\n", computerScore);
    
    if (computerScore > 21 || humanScore > computerScore) {
        printf("You win!\n");
    } else if (humanScore == computerScore) {
        printf("It's a tie!\n");
    } else {
        printf("You lose.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

This code simulates a simple blackjack game where the human player can choose to hit or stay. 
After the human player finishes their turn, the computer player will play all their moves. 
The winner is determined based on the final scores of both players.
