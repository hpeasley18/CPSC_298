While type systems provide strong guarantees within the code itself, formal specifications offer a broader view of a system's behavior and properties. Here's how we can combine the above example with a formal specification:

Formal Specification:

We can use a formal notation like Z or TLA+ to express the desired behavior of the login function:

// Z notation
login : 
  username : EMAIL ->
  password : SECURE_STRING ->
  hashed_password : HASHED_PASSWORD ->
  user_exists? : BOOL ->
  valid_password? : BOOL ->
  authenticated? : BOOL
  
// Precondition: User exists and password is valid
user_exists?(username) ∧ valid_password?(password)

// Postcondition: Authentication successful iff password matches stored hash
authenticated? ⇔ password = stored_hash(username)

// Stored hash is always generated using a secure algorithm
∀ username : EMAIL ◂ secure_hash_algorithm(stored_hash(username))
Combining with TypeScript:

Type Aliases: Map formal types to TypeScript interfaces:
TypeScript
type Email = string; // Enforce email format validation later
type SecureString = string; // Enforce password requirements later
type HashedPassword = { algorithm: string; value: string };

Precondition Checks: Add assertions for preconditions before sensitive operations:
TypeScript
function login(credentials: { username: Email; password: SecureString }): boolean {
  if (!userExists(credentials.username)) {
    throw new Error("User does not exist");
  }
  if (!isValidPassword(credentials.password)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid password format");
  }
  // ...
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Postcondition Verification (Testing): Write unit tests that verify postcondition properties:
TypeScript
it("should authenticate with valid credentials", () => {
  const user = createUser("john@example.com", "strong_password");
  const authenticated = login({ username: user.username, password: user.password });
  expect(authenticated).toBe(true);
});

Additional Considerations:

Formal specifications can cover more complex system interactions beyond code.
Tooling can automate verification of code against formal specifications.
Balancing the level of formality with development agility is crucial.
Benefits:

Combining type theory and formal specifications provides stronger guarantees about system behavior.
Catches errors early in the development process.
Improves code clarity and maintainability.
Challenges:

Writing formal specifications requires additional effort and expertise.
Integrating formal verification tools into development workflows can be complex.
By combining type systems with formal specifications, we can build more secure and reliable TypeScript applications, leveraging the strengths of both approaches for improved software quality.
