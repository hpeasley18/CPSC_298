LLMs, or Large Language Models, are AI systems trained to 
understand and generate human-like text from lots of data. 
Tokenizers process that text into individual tokens, which 
are then fed into LLMs for more processing. Mixture of Experts, 
within LLM architectures, allows for specialized models to collaborate 
on tasks, and enhance performance. Coding Assistance utilizes LLMs to 
provide support to developers, offering features like code completion, 
like CoPilot, and bug detection based on contextual understanding of 
programming languages.
